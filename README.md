## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- Nmap (for generating scan files)
- Groq API key (for LLM integration)

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the backend directory**:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Set up environment variables**: Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with:

   ```plaintext
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   ```
4. **Start the backend server**:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   The server runs on `http://localhost:8000`.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The frontend runs on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Optional: Docker Deployment

1. **Build and run**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This sets up both backend and frontend in a containerized environment.

## Usage Guide

1. **Register & Log In**:
   - Sign up with a username, email, and password via the login page.
   - Log in to access secure, user-specific features.
2. **Generate Nmap Scan**:
   - Run an Nmap scan with vulnerability scripts to generate an XML file:

     ```bash
     nmap -sV --script vulners example.com -oX filename.xml
     ```

     Alternatively, use the `vuln` script for comprehensive vulnerability scanning:

     ```bash
     nmap -sV --script=vuln <target ip> -oX filename.xml
     ```

     **Warning**: Ensure you have permission to scan the target. Unauthorized scanning is illegal and unethical.
3. **Upload Scans**:
   - Use the drag-and-drop interface to upload the generated Nmap XML scan file.
   - The system automatically parses files and provides AI-driven vulnerability analysis.
4. **Explore Dashboard**:
   - View real-time statistics, risk trends, and service analytics.
   - Interact with charts for timeline and risk breakdowns.
5. **Engage with AI Chatbot**:
   - Query the AI for context-aware security advice and patch guidance.
6. **Generate Reports**:
   - Export professional PDF reports with detailed vulnerability insights.
   - Download automated patch scripts for quick remediation.
   - **Sample Report**:
